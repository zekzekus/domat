Domat
=====

Domat is an experimental attempt to create an application for teams to use [Pomodoro Technique](http://pomodorotechnique.com/) to achieve greater productivity.

I want to make use of realtime capabilities of [Meteor](http://www.meteor.com/) as much as i can. 

What the heck is "Domat" mean?
------------------------------

In some regions of [TÃ¼rkiye](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C3%BCrkiye), the word "Domat" means "Domates" which means -guess what?- "Tomatoe"
