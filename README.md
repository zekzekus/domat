Domat
=====

Domat is an experimental attempt to create an application for teams to use [Pomodoro Technique](http://pomodorotechnique.com/) to achieve greater productivity.

I want to make use of realtime capabilities of [Meteor](http://www.meteor.com/) as much as i can.

What the heck is "Domat" mean?
------------------------------

In some regions of [TÃ¼rkiye](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C3%BCrkiye), the word "Domat" means "Domates" which means -guess what?- "Tomatoe"

Status
------
* A simple task/todo manager fully implemented (add, edit, delete, toggle
  complete)
* A simple and task independant countdown timer implemented as a proof of
  concept
* Timer developed a little bit with visual enchancements. Bigger, nicer, eye
  catching etc.

TODO
----
* Countdown timer start values must be configurable for each user or group.
* Timer must be more pomodoro like. Work cycle, rest cycle, long rest etc.
* A relation must exist between tasks and timer instances. To count completed
  pomodoros for a task.
* A group mechanism may be applied. Think about to apply pomodoro technique for
  groups.
* For individuals and groups think about visualisation of pomodoros started,
  going on, finished.
* Reporting tools of pomodoro system. Task inventory, daily list etc.

TODO (Utopics)
--------------
* Implement a plugin system to provide integration between popular task/issue
  management systems like redmine, bugzilla, jira etc.
