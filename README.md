Domat
=====

Domat is an experimental attempt to create an application for teams to use [Pomodoro Technique](http://pomodorotechnique.com/) to achieve greater productivity.

I want to make use of realtime capabilities of [Meteor](http://www.meteor.com/) as much as i can.

What the heck is "Domat" mean?
------------------------------

In some regions of [TÃ¼rkiye](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C3%BCrkiye), the word "Domat" means "Domates" which means -guess what?- "Tomatoe"

Status
------
I added CHANGELOG file. [Here](https://github.com/zekzekus/domat/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).
TODO
----
I moved todo items to github issues. [Here](https://github.com/zekzekus/domat/issues?state=open).

Want to try?
------------
There is ~~nothing much to see right now~~  plenty of functionality implemented ~~but~~ and if you ~~insist~~ want to see the progress you can try it [here](http://domat.meteor.com/).

Or to try locally:

    git clone https://github.com/zekzekus/domat.git
    cd domat
    meteor

then visit [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) with your browser.
